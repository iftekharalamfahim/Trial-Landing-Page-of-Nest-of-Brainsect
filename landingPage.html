                    <h1>Trial of <em>nest of Brainsect</em></h1>
                    <div style="font-size: 0.5rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">31<sup>st</sup> January, 2025</div>
                    <p >After two weeks of simple learning and practicing I was able to write down a demo website called, <em>Nest of Brainsect</em>.</p>
                    <p>The basic idea was to design and create a responsive website, themed on 1940s newspaper. I am thinking about receating <em>The Telegraph</em> from 1940s (WWII era). I have seen some examples in <em>google's news archive.</em> More column on my inspiring websites and designs will be written later. </p>
                    <p>The motivation behind my idea was, basically if we try to analysis today's websites, they are the same like the newspaper or magazines from 18's & 19's century.  I will try to make the websites completely unique.</p>
                    <p>This is just a trial and demo page where I tried to impliment some basics that I have learned so far. <b>This is NOT near to the final version.</b> It is expected that there will be a lot of bug and broken link in this demo. I hope to learn from those mistakes.</p>

                    <p>While brainstorming the idea and design, I tried to search for any existing website that can comprehends with my thinking. And fortunately, I found a similar idea post from <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/m1hdgj/websites_that_look_like_newspapers/>reddit.</a>This website's design matches mostly with my idea. </p>

                    <p class="recent-books">Recently my best friend suggested me to read <em>Heggel</em>, a German philosopher. So I thought why not start with the very first book of his career and I've downloaded the pdf copy of <em><b> The Phenomenology of Spirit.</b></em>It's one of those hard books which bear the dark philosophy. Let's see if I can finish the book or it stays <a href="./unfinishedBooks.html">unfinished</a> like many more great books I haven't yet completed (I hope I can finish them one day). </p>
                    <p> Btw, you can checkout my <a href="#"> library</a>. Let's have some tea/coffee while exchanging the world of knowledge.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday I watched this fantastic movie, directed by <em>Francis Coppola.</em> The movie is based on Vietnam war. A soldier named, captain Williard was assigned to assasinate a major, who was the best in the US special force but suddenly got insane. The movie dives through the horror of war and how it effects not only the people but also the soldiers of wars.</p>
                        <p>But the main attraction of the movie is it's story telling and the visual implementation. Maybe I can't describe it in actual words but it's for sure one of the greatest movie I have ever seen and 10000% recommendable.</p>

                    <p>As every other bachelor day, today I also cooked egg-fried rice for my post-midnight food aka dinner. But this time it was a little bit exeptional than other days fried-rice.</p>
                    <p>Because for the first time I've used olive oil, like <em>Chef Gordon</em>, instead of regular cooking oil. The unfortunate thing is, it didn't taste bad. It has a good smell and the tasted a little bit sweet. I also tried some tomato ketchup with it. So basically it tasted, sweet, sour, spicy and salty. That's why maybe it tasted good it my mouth. Because my tounge was exposed to all the test buds that is available. I don't know actually. The only thing I know is, I have enjoyed it. </p>
